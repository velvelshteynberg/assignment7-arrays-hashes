expenses = [250, 7.95, 30.95, 16.50]


def sum_total()
expenses.each do |number|
    total = 0
    total = total + number
end 
    return total
end

#the problem with this solution is that it gives me the sums in ascending order. I only want the final sum. 







puts expenses.sum

#the problem with this is that it looks too simple
